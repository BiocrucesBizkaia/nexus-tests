# nexus-tests
Testing the local installation of Nexus. For the moment just tested the [tutorial](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/tree/master/tutorial) stuff against the [BBP-Nexus EFPL server](https://bbp-nexus.epfl.ch/staging/explorer/sandbox/genomics/person/v0.1.0) with `test.py` (The Jupyter Notebook didn't work properly). 

Next: test against the [local](http://localhost/) installation that runs on [Docker](https://bluebrain.github.io/nexus/docs/getting-started/running-nexus/docker.html).
